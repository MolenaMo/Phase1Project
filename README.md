# Phase1Project
The Activity Bot app provides random activities to do when the user clicks on the "activities" button. The button has a once over "mouseenter" event. The bot graphic, created in CSS, has a hover effect. The app's header has a mouseover event; the text changes color, and then reverts back after a half a second.
There is also a drop down to the left, entitled "Cutie Bot's Home Planet" that displays the origins (who created) the robot graphic.
